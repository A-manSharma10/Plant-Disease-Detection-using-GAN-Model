🌿 Plant Disease Detection using GANs, ResNet34 & MobileNetV2
This project implements an end-to-end plant disease detection system using Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) for data augmentation and deep learning models (ResNet34 and MobileNetV2) for classification. It also includes a Gradio-based web interface and Wikipedia API integration for contextual disease information.

🚀 Features
DCGAN-based synthetic image generation for robust dataset augmentation.

ResNet34 classifier for high-accuracy disease classification.

Hugging Face MobileNetV2 model for inference on plant disease datasets.

Gradio Web App for real-time user interaction.

Wikipedia integration to display detailed information about predicted diseases.

Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUROC, Confusion Matrix.
